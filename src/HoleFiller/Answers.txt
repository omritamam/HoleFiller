1. For each pixel in the hole , the pixel is replaced by the average of the pixels in the border.
Finding the weight and distance of each pixel to another pixel in is O(1) runtime complexity.
Thus, the runtime is O(n*m) * O(1) = O(n*m) where n is the number of pixels in the hole and m is the number of pixels in the border.

2. Actually we don't have to measure all weights and distances of a hole pixel to all the borders pixels,
but we can measure only the weights and distances of a hole pixel to its neighbors.
In this case, the runtime is O(n) * O(1) = O(n) where n is the number of pixels in the hole.
